            <p class="content_normal">The premier of Polish language version of Google Assistant is one of the most 
                anticipated events of 2019. Google enabled all companies to add ‘Actions’ 
                to the Assistant. ‘Actions’ are applications that enrich assistant’s offering. 
                Marketers were thrilled to see this new channel of communication with 
                consumers. Below, you will find 6 challenges they will face when using voice 
                assistant in communication of their brands.</p>

            <p class="content_bold">1st challenge: how to present your brand 
                solely by using sound?</p>
                <p class="content_normal">Brands that have not employed any coherent and specified language, 
                    tonality, sound effects or music in their “brand books” so far will have to add 
                    these elements without any delay. The sound identity will have to be present 
                    in other media mix channels, not only in the assistant itself. The good sound-
                    based identity is composed of specific spectrum of sounds and voices. 
                    Therefore, the importance of recognizable readers and voice actors will 
                    increase.</p>

                algorithm of the voice assistant to make 
                it remember our brand?</p>
            <p class="content_normal">Brands that have not employed any coherent and specified language, 
                tonality, sound effects or music in their “brand books” so far will have to add 
                these elements without any delay. The sound identity will have to be present

        <div class="container">
            <p class="content_bold">3rd challenge: how to become the voice assistant’s first choice?</p>
            <p class="content_normal">Unlike the website browser, which offers the user a few pages of possible 
                solutions, the voice assistant provides one answer, as much adjusted 
                to preferences as possible. Much like the “second Google page” is the 
                synonym of oblivion, each place other than the first one will be treated 
                as such in case of voice assistant.                
                <br><br>
                So, placing the brand in the voice assistant’s search engine to ensure that 
                it occupies the first place is the key problem marketers should focus on.

            <p class="content_bold">4th challenge: questions for assistant are the part of never-ending conversation.</p>
            <p class="content_normal">Questions addressed to the assistant are not isolated. They are part of one, 
                never ending conversation, during which the assistant learns about the user. 
                It is important to remember that the context of each question is based also 
                on previous interactions of the user in other communication channels. Only 
                exhaustive and well-matched response will be regarded as valuable to the 
                user.</p>

    <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid jumbotron_1 services_2">
        <div class="container">
            <p class="content_normal">To build accurate answer, the brand relies on integration and aggregation 
                of data from many sources and channels of user’s integration. Plus, efficient 
                processing of such data in a real-time.
                <br><br>
                Data to integrate will include product-related information, CRM, analytical 
                data, history of integration in other channels, big data etc. It is all to enable 
                artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to get a grip 
                on a context and to have a good base to build answers that users find 
                satisfactory.
                <br><br>
                It is worth remembering that conversations are happening „now and here”, 
                so the infrastructure will have to manage integration and synthesis 
                of enormous amount of data in a real time.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <p class="content_bold">5th challenge: different characteristics of interface.</p>
            <p class="content_normal">Different features of the interface mean that skills and applications of voice 
                assistants will require different team of people, knowledge and work 
                methodologies than have been used so far in marketing departments.
                <br><br>
                Because the visual aspect of voice assistants is less important, the role of art 
                director/graphic designer is also less important. We can observe decreasing 
                meaning of CI, all types of acceptances or testing of user’s graphic interface.
                <br><br>
                On the other hand, personality designing skills, copywriting and linguistics 
                competencies gain more value.
                <br><br>
                Analytical functions and quality assurance will still be very important, but 
                the specificity of work related thereto will be a bit different than before.
                <br><br>
                Transferring already produced skills of voice assistant to new markets will 
                be hard because of strong reliance on language.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <p class="content_bold">6th challenge: unpredictable directions of voice assistant’s development.</p>
            <p class="content_normal">Voice assistants are the new solution for everyone today. Consumers will 
                slowly learn how to use it and we need to watch their behaviors and prepare 
                ourselves for many surprises and unpredictable ways of development.
                <br><br>
                We have to adopt advanced approach to the dynamic growth of this area 
                of digital marketing, though it is still in its “baby-like” stage.
                <br><br>
                So, preparation of first skills and applications of voice assistant will constitute 
                the basic step to create strategy of the brand’s presence in this field, its 
                constant monitoring and optimization.</p>
